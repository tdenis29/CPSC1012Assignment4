namespace CPSC1012Assignment4;
using ClientClass;

// The program build will be developed in two parts:
// Part A – Class and Object Implementation
// Client Class
// Design a class named Client that meets the following requirements:
//     A string field to store the client's first name and a corresponding property FirstName with both get and set
//         The first name cannot be empty, null, or whitespace; ensure that the stored value is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace
//     A string field to store the client's last name and a corresponding property LastName with both get and set
//         The last name cannot be empty, null, or whitespace; ensure that the stored value is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace
//     An int field to store the client's weight in pounds and a corresponding property Weight with both get and set
//         The weight must be greater than zero
//     An int field to store the client's height in inches and a corresponding property Height with both get and set
//         The weight must be greater than zero
//     A greedy constructor that requires the first name, last name, weight, and height as parameters
//         Use the properties in the constructor for setting the fields to take advantage of any validation checks already coded
//     A read-only property named BmiScore that will return as a double the BMI score for the client
//     A read-only property named BmiStatus that will return as a string the BMI status for the corresponding BMI score
//     A read-only property named FullName that will return as a string the client's full name in the format Lastname, FirstName
// Additional Information
// The formula to calculate a client's weight follows:
// Formula: weight / height2 x 703
// Where height is in inches and weight is in pounds.
// The status for corresponding BMI values are as follows:
// BMI Score 	Status
// <= 18.4 	Underweight
// 18.5 - 24.9 	Normal
// 25.0 - 39.9 	Overweight
// >= 40 	Obese
// Write a program to test your Client class as shown in the sample run below. The program must, at a minimum, demonstrate the following:
//     a. prompt for a string
//     b. prompt for an int
//     c. create an instance of Client
//     d. display the status or score, depending on user request, along with full client name
//     e. have user friendly error handling (i.e. the program must not crash)

// Sample Program Run (Part A implementation)

// NOTE: the sample run does not demonstrate exception handling, ensure your program handles exceptions gracefully and does not crash.

{
    static void Main(string[] args)
