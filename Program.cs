// The program build will be developed in two parts:
// Write a program to test your Client class as shown in the sample run below. The program must, at a minimum, demonstrate the following:
//     a. prompt for a string
//     b. prompt for an int
//     c. create an instance of Client
//     d. display the status or score, depending on user request, along with full client name
//     e. have user friendly error handling (i.e. the program must not crash)
// NOTE: the sample run does not demonstrate exception handling, ensure your program handles exceptions gracefully and does not crash.
