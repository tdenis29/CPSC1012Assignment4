// The program build will be developed in two parts:
// Part A â€“ Class and Object Implementation
// Client Class
// Design a class named Client that meets the following requirements:
//     A string field to store the client's first name and a corresponding property FirstName with both get and set
//         The first name cannot be empty, null, or whitespace; ensure that the stored value is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace
//     A string field to store the client's last name and a corresponding property LastName with both get and set
//         The last name cannot be empty, null, or whitespace; ensure that the stored value is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace
//     An int field to store the client's weight in pounds and a corresponding property Weight with both get and set
//         The weight must be greater than zero
//     An int field to store the client's height in inches and a corresponding property Height with both get and set
//         The weight must be greater than zero
//     A greedy constructor that requires the first name, last name, weight, and height as parameters
//         Use the properties in the constructor for setting the fields to take advantage of any validation checks already coded
//     A read-only property named BmiScore that will return as a double the BMI score for the client
//     A read-only property named BmiStatus that will return as a string the BMI status for the corresponding BMI score
//     A read-only property named FullName that will return as a string the client's full name in the format Lastname, FirstName
